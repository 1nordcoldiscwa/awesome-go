*Gost* tells the story of a young man named Janko, who returns to his native village after fighting in the Partisan resistance against the Nazi occupation. He finds his home destroyed and his family gone, except for his old father who barely recognizes him. Janko decides to stay in the village and rebuild his life, but he soon faces hostility and suspicion from the locals, who consider him a traitor and a deserter. The only person who shows him kindness is a mysterious woman named Mara, who lives alone in a hut near the forest. She invites Janko to stay with her as her guest, and they develop a close bond. However, their relationship is threatened by the arrival of a group of Chetniks, Serbian nationalist guerrillas who collaborate with the Nazis and terrorize the villagers. Janko has to make a choice between staying with Mara or joining the Partisans again.
 
*Gost* is a powerful and moving story that explores the themes of war, trauma, identity, loyalty, love, and survival. It also reflects Kaleb's own experiences as a Partisan fighter and a witness of the atrocities committed by both sides during the war. The novella has been translated into several languages and adapted into a film in 1966.
